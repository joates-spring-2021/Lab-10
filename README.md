# Lab-10 - Web API

This is the lab we already started together as a class. If you were able to download the plotly package using PIP, use the GitHub web API to get the top starred projects, and generate the html graph, then just copy and paste your code onto this main.py template file and submit to Gradescope.

# If you haven't started it yet...
Here's what you need to do:
- Start by following the class text (Python Crash Course) in Chapter 15 up through figure 15-3 to learn PIP and chart creation
- Next, use PIP to install the package "plotly" and the package "requests"
- Then jump ahead to Chapter 17 and follow all the way to Figure 17-1

Your final output should be an html file that shows the top starred projecs on GitHub.

You will get a full 10 points on Gradescope as long as you upload a file called main.py. Then I will go through the assignments and make sure all the elements are there. So your final grade will be on Canvas.
